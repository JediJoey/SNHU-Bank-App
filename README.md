# SNHU-Bank-App

---------------------
Module 8 - Assignment
---------------------

- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This was an application to calulate compound interest for a bank.

- What did you do particularly well?
  The thing I did particualary well in this project was the input validation, and abstracting the methods into a class for code reuse.
  
- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  There is still some redundant code in the input validation.  Could be moved to their own methods.  Could extend parent class as part of sub classes.  Inheritence would work here but from everything I've been reading outside of this course, inheritance could cause my code to become more tightly coupled and confusing overtime.  I may end up using some kind of utilities class for input validation, but even that is just a band-aid to cover up the symptom.
  
- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The report methods were particulary confusing.  Most of the time consuming issues I ran into had to do with configuring the linker for vscode though.  I have started using chat gpt to help me program when I have already read the documentation and have gotten stuck.  Also I have a mentor that I can always reach out to about programming related questions.
  
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Using classes is a good fundamental skil for programmers to know.  I will definately continue to learn design patterns and utilize them.
  
  
- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made it these things by using abstraction, inheritance, and encapsulation.
